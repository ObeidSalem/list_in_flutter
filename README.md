List in Flutter

Using List in Flutter
We learn a little bit about creating your app from scratch and using buttons and creating actions.

In this assignment, you will create:

1) a flutter app

2) create an object with hard coded list of items, for example apple, orange, rambutan...

3) Create a textbox widget to enter a choice of 1,2,3,or ...

4, Create a button to access the list and display the content of the list depending on what was chosen on the textbox.

So if 1 is entered in the textbox, than, display apple.
Create a github, and submit the link to your repo for this assignment.
